This portfolio project is the culmination of two terms introductory computer science classes at Oregon State University.
CS161: Intro to Computer Science I and CS162: Intro to Computer Science II focus on the fundamentals of obeject-oriented programming
in Python.
All coding and debugging was carried out in the PyCharm IDE.

Description:
  Program introduces a class, ChessVar, that allows users to play a modified version of chess that features
  no specialty movements (castling, en passant, etc.) and no 'check' or 'checkmate.' Victory is declared by
  capturing all opposing pieces of a single type: two Knights, two Bishops, two Rooks, one King, one Queen
  or eight Pawns. All other standard chess rules apply. Program also features support classes for ChessVar:
  ChessBoard and GamePiece. GamePiece has a separate subclass for each standard chess piece.
